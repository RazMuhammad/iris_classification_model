# iris_classification_model

## Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used as a beginner's introduction to pattern recognition. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These samples are classified into three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

**Data Exploration:** Initial analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
**Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification.
**Model Training:** Training the selected models on the training data.
**Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using various metrics and visualizations.
**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning model parameters to improve performance.
**Model Deployment:** Exporting the trained model for future use in predictions.
